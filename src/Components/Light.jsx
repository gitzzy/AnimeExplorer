      <p>Yo Light ✨,

I know I messed up and it kinda pissed you off, and I just wanna say I’m sorry fr. 🙏
Didn’t mean to hurt you or make you feel some type of way — you’re too important to me for that.
I value our vibe a lot, and I don’t wanna let something small mess up the bond we got.

So, let’s not stay stuck on the L. Let me make it up to you — boba/food/whatever you’re down for, my treat. 🫶

Stay chill, bestie, don’t ghost me forever 😭.
